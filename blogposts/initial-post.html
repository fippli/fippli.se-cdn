    Initial Post

    <b>
      After thinking and thinking about what to write in my initial post I
      figured out that it's best to jut rant about something. For example that
      Apple and Google uses the COVID-19 crisis as an opportunity to gather more
      data from smartphone users around the world.

    I found out throught this article
    <a
      href="https://www.euronews.com/2020/04/10/apple-google-say-they-ll-work-together-trace-spread-coronavirus-n1181301"

    that Apple and Google is cooperating to build a program that traces the
    spread of the Corona virus. As described here
    <a

    they have a goal to build this functionalty into their operating systems. I
    guess it's the right time for them to introduce these ideas now when people
    are still worried and in fear of what will happen with this pandemic.

    You would expect that the journalists would start asking critical questions
    about integrity or legal aspects. You would expect them to consider the
    thoughts and ideas of the activists or lawyers to balance the perspectives
    of these tech monopolies. Hah! Joking!!! Obviously there are no such
    questions in the minds of the journalists, just... void.
  </p>

    Seems like the journalism means something different than what you would
    expect. Instead of investigating stuff it's more about technical
    documentation, description products, and convincing the public that this is
    only for the good. Reading this:
    <a
      href="https://www.svt.se/nyheter/utrikes/techjattar-i-samarbete-for-smittsparning"
      >https://www.svt.se/nyheter/utrikes/techjattar-i-samarbete-for-smittsparning</a
    >
    I find the word <i>integrity</i> once. The tone of the article is rather:
    "potential att bli en heltäckande global lösning" which translates to
    "potential to become a full global solution". Why are there no questions
    about longterm implications? Is the assurance from Apple and Google that
    "it's safe" enough for journalists to think "Oh, ok, well thats nice!"?
  </p>

  <p>
    Who will be an opposing force to this <i>surveillance naivety</i>? What is
    the purpose of journalism if it is not educating, investigating, ctirtical
    or have any form of depth what so ever? What is the point of reading short
    articles that simply retell what says on other websites like a bad version
    of a retweet?
  </p>

  <p>
    So what are the longterm goals for this kind of technology? What do we
    actually need it for? We know how the virus spreads. If infected people
    spray snot around on people that are not infected they will likle be after
    the shower. Therefore the recommendation is to stay home if you are sick.
    Maybe it's to find people who are sick but are quarantine rebels that
    doesn't give a poop about staying home even if they are sick. It might be
    easier to condemn them and hopefully make it illegal to be sick. And we can
    anonymously prove that you are guilty!

    Well there is not much to do about it. There are no good alternatives for
    these platforms anyway. Looked into Librem 5
    <a href="https://puri.sm/products/librem-5/"

    a bit. But it seems a bit chunky. Let us just hope that Librem 6, 7 or 8 or
    something becomes super cool.
